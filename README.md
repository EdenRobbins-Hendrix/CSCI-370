Aesthetics: Everything's fish themed! \
\
Joys: It was fun learning the basics of unity, and it's nice to have something that you can show other people that you yourself made. I also learned how to navigate the unity documentation. \
\
Struggkes: It was a pain learning the basics of unity, and it's frustrating when you repeatedly fail to get different scripts to communicate with each other, delete a game object, or so such. Also, the documentation is very difficult to navigate. \

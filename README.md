Game Name: Small Pond \
\
Intent: Be a bullet hell-esque game with an exhaustion mechanic \
\
Narrative Structure: The tale of a small fish trying to survive by eating food and avoiding predators \
\
Mechanics: Energy decreases as you move, eating food increases your energy as well as score, you die if you run out of energy or collide with a predator \
\
Aesthetics: Everything's fish themed! \
\
Joys: It was fun learning the basics of unity, and it's nice to have something that you can show other people that you yourself made. I also learned how to navigate the unity documentation. \
\
Struggles: It was a pain learning the basics of unity, and it's frustrating when you repeatedly fail to get different scripts to communicate with each other, delete a game object, or so such. Also, the documentation is very difficult to navigate. Also, we never quite managed to get the collision between the player and the predators to work properly. We never even figured out what was wrong! \
